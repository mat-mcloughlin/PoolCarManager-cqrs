===================

# Todo 
- Figure out how to test the domain using embedded stores. Should I be ignoring unit testing for the most part and just have integration tests?
- Test the website
- Figure out a way to validate the commands for duff data
- Look at replacing membus with my own implementation. Preferably one that checks for a one to one relationship between command and handler
